          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>The first trimester has been a rollercoaster ride for me. I've learned so much and had awesome bondings with my friends, classmates, and families. One of the highlights was me training for football varsity, where I got to learn how to play football. I also struggled with some learning concepts, but with the help of my teachers, I was able to understand them better. Overall, I'm grateful for the experiences I've had so far.</p>
